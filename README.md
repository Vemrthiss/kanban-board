## Deployment
Site deployed [here] (vigorous-pike-8d0385.netlify.app)

## Known Issues/Potential Improvement
Webapp uses drag-and-drop functionality for moving the cards around, which is not as appropriate for mobile.
As such, there are these current issues to work on:
1. Webapp coded only for laptop/desktop views, a mobile and tablet view (touch devices) to KIV
2. Should a mobile view be done, also code an alternative logic for moving the cards around
